            <p class="card-body">Investors deposit capital into secure accounts that are pooled and managed on their behalf. Our objective is to deliver accessible, institutional-grade exposure
              to disciplined trading strategies so investors can participate in systematic profit generation without direct market interaction.</p>

            <div class="card-head"><div class="emoji">📊</div><h4>Investment Model</h4></div>
            <p class="card-body">Our model follows a clear, auditable flow: investors deposit funds, capital is allocated into pooled strategies, professional traders execute trades,
              and realized profits are measured and distributed to investors daily. Typical profit-sharing ranges are approximately 4%–8% per day, depending on market conditions
              and the investor's balance; actual returns vary and cannot be guaranteed.</p>

              Capital protection measures and continuous monitoring aim to limit downside drawdowns while allowing for measured, sustainable growth.</p>

            <p class="card-body">Realized profits are calculated on a daily basis, credited to investor accounts, and made visible in the dashboard in near real-time.
              Distribution is proportional to each investor's share of the pooled capital for the distribution period. Payouts are documented and auditable within your account history.</p>
